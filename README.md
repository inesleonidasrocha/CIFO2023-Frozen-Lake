<h2>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</h2>

This project focuses on solving the Frozen Lake Problem using Genetic Algorithm (GA) techniques. For the development of the project, we implemented and evaluated various selection, crossover, and mutation methods within the framework of GA for problem-solving. The main objective of this was to assess their performance, convergence, and effectiveness and compare their efficacy in achieving optimal solutions.

<h3>Files:</h3>
charles.py - serves as a foundation for implementing individuals and populations, and facilitates the evolutionary process through selection, crossover, and mutation.<br>
FL_fitness.py - focuses on defining the fitness function for the FLP using the Gym library.<br>
selection.py - we have implemented three distinct selection algorithms, namely Tournament, Roulette and Rank.<br>
crossover.py - we implemented six crossover algorithms – Arithmetic, Single Point, Multi-Point, Uniform, Uniform Mask and Heuristic.<br> mutation.py - we have incorporated three mutation algorithms, namely Scramble, Swap and Inversion.<br>
main.py - experiments by applying various configurations of genetic algorithms to solve the FLP.
