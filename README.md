<a name="br2"></a>PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This report focuses on solving the Frozen Lake Problem (FLP) using Genetic Algorithm (GA) techniques. For the development of the project, we implemented and evaluated various selection, crossover, and mutation methods within the framework of GA for problem-solving. The main objective of this was to assess their performance, convergence, and effectiveness and compare their efficacy in achieving optimal solutions.![image](https://github.com/inesleonidasrocha/CIFO2023-Frozen-Lake/assets/93428766/f6994112-3e50-4dff-af39-4416b9fd05e0)
